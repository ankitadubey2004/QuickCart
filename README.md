# 🛒 QuickCart – A Smart, Minimal One-Click Grocery Checkout App

QuickCart is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) built for lightning-fast online grocery shopping. Designed with low-data and high-speed goals in mind, the app lets users complete their entire order journey in under 60 seconds using AI-powered suggestions and 1-click checkout.

As part of my Software Developer Internship, I was responsible for building the frontend of the app and integrating it with a pre-developed backend via secure APIs.
